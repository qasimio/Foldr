```

Requires Python 3.10+. Works on **Windows**, **Linux**, **macOS**

## Why FOLDR?

Every Downloads folder eventually turns a junk drawer.

Duplicates. Screenshots. PDFs. ZIP files. Random installers.

Most file organizers either move everything blindly or force you into complicated rules.

FOLDR takes a different approach.

- Preview every operation before anything changes.
- Undo any organize operation.
- Never overwrite existing files.
- Watch folders continuously in the background.
- Keep your filesystem predictable.

Automation should save time, not create anxiety.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Preview what would happen (nothing moves)
foldr ~/Downloads --preview

# Organize (shows preview, asks to confirm)
foldr ~/Downloads

# Undo the last operation
foldr undo

# Watch a folder — organize now and keep watching
foldr watch ~/Downloads
```

> **Paths with spaces** must be quoted:
> ```bash
> foldr "D:\My Downloads" --preview
> ```
```

## Why you can trust FOLDR

- **Preview by default** — FOLDR shows you what it will do and asks before moving anything.
- **Folders are never touched** — only files are moved; directories stay where they are.
- **Conflict-safe** — if a file with the same name already exists at the destination, FOLDR renames the incoming file (`photo_(1).jpg`, etc.) rather than overwriting.
- **Undo anything** — every operation is reversible via `foldr undo`.
- **Dedup is the only irreversible action** — always use `--preview` before `--dedup`.
