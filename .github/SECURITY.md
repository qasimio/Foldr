## Scope

FOLDR is a local file organizer — it reads and moves files on the local filesystem only. It does not make network requests, store credentials, or run with elevated privileges. Security concerns are most likely to involve:

- Path traversal when organizing directories with unusual names
- Race conditions during file moves
- Log file contents (watch logs are written to `~/.foldr/watch_logs/`)
